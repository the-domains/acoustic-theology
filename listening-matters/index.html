But what is unique about this pursuit, this kind of listening, is that it offers the possibility for tethering hearers, not to a past, but to a future given to this Jesus first, and to us also. Strange thoughts, but, for the Christian, true. This first listening opens up the possibility of hearing the world in a new way. The world for the Christian includes the church and it's worshiping community centering confidence and doubt in this Jesus and his Spirit. And also, opening up the Christian to the world of one's neighbor, friend, and stranger. </p><picture>
