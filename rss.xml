            <description><![CDATA[<p>this is an experiment. it's a thought experiment of sorts, where curiosity intersects with the realities of life, where play is incubator for curating communities of trust, and where disruptive interruptions offer expanding futures. welcome to my experiment of putting language to embodied existence. welcome to my testing ground for how i am learning to understand the world from particular instances along the way. i am an overly privileged, white boy from a suburban community whose wisdom has grown only by learning to listen to and with others. no matter how you arrived here, whether by chance, in good will or in critique, your thoughts are welcome as a fellow companion with me in my own curiosity, play, and disruptive tendencies. welcome. </p>]]></description>
