Listening is an embodied thingy, meaning that when we listen it isn't just the words that are making sense to us. Words are accompanied by embodied gestures that either affirm or disrupt their intended goal. The goal isn't only to inform, of course, as if to convey an idea. Perhaps words is are deeper than that in that they communicate a longing to connect, relate, to form community. 

Listening as a Christian, and for me, takes two forms. The first relates to this One who God confessed as Lord (Phil. 2), whose very life for the Christian identifies God's promise of bearing with the world. This Jesus becomes the one Christians attend to because in attending there's a possibility where we could be convinced that God has not abandoned the world, but in fact, is present in particular ways with the world, among humans and in creation. 

For the Christian this first form of listening comes by hearing words of his life recorded in the Christian scriptures. But what is unique about this pursuit, this kind of listening, is that it offers the possibility for tethering hearers, not to a past, but to a future given to this Jesus first, and to us also. Strange thoughts, but, for the Christian, true. This first listening opens up the possibility of hearing the world in a new way. The world for the Christian includes the church and it's worshiping community centering confidence and doubt in this Jesus and his Spirit. And also, opening up the Christian to the world of one's neighbor, friend, and stranger. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c1a1c5cd-0c40-472e-a5f2-b4dd9f3ff7a2.jpg)
